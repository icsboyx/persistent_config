# persistent_config_core

This crate provides the core functionality for the [`persistent_config`](../) crate.

It is not intended to be used directly by end users. Instead, use the main [`persistent_config`](../) crate, which re-exports and integrates this core library for ergonomic persistent configuration management in Rust.

For usage and documentation, see the [persistent_config README](../README.md).

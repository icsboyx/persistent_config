# persistent_config_macros

This crate provides the procedural macros for the [`persistent_config`] crate, such as the `Persistent` derive macro.

It is not intended to be used directly by end users. Instead, use the main [`persistent_config`] crate, which re-exports and integrates these macros for ergonomic persistent configuration management in Rust.
